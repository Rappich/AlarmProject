# AlarmProject

**Overview**
This project involves creating a modular console application for a security company to manage and simulate alarm systems. 
The program integrates with both SQL and NoSQL databases and allows for functionality such as customer registration, alarm testing, and user activity simulation.

**Development To-Do List**
Phase 1: Setup
[] Create the project structure.
[] Define models for customers, users, alarm systems, and components.
[] Implement a database interface and NoSQL functionality (JSON).

Phase 2: Core Functionality
[] Build the user interface (console-based).
[] Enable customer and alarm system registration.
[] Add functionality to register alarm components.
[] Implement alarm system testing with verification.

Phase 3: Database Integration
[] Add SQL or JSON support using SQLite or Nhlmann.
[] Ensure data persistence between program runs.
[] Allow database type selection at initialization.

Phase 4: Advanced Features (Optional)
[] Simulate customer interactions (alarm activation/deactivation).
[] Log user activities with timestamps.
[] Add advanced database queries and reports.

Phase 5: Testing and Documentation
[] Create unit tests for all key features.
[] Document the code and create user guides.
[] Prepare for final demonstration.
